      "body": "We chose this edition not just for its rarity, but for its weight. When you hold this Arion Press edition, you feel the heft of the Pequod itself. The deep blue goatskin binding is cool to the touch, reminiscent of the Atlantic depths. It is not merely a story of a whale; it is a companion for your own voyages into the unknown. It demands patience, but offers a friendship that is vast, deep, and eternal.",
